(2:01:54 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ok :P sorry, i was asleep
(2:01:55 PM) Silentspy: now i got my mod running on my server
(2:01:56 PM) Silentspy: :D
(2:02:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: forgot to set myself away
(2:02:11 PM) Silentspy: thanks to mae and smbarbour <3
(2:02:11 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:02:15 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: cool <3
(2:02:35 PM) Maeyanie: cpw: Anything r5 or later should be pretty much identical, only some config options changed.
(2:02:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: sillyfilly_rzn0
(2:02:40 PM) Silentspy: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7263641/2012-02-20_20.54.32.png
(2:02:40 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: what did you need?
(2:02:43 PM) Silentspy: that is the mod btw
(2:02:54 PM) Silentspy: the bread thing :P pretty simple, but it replaces normal bread
(2:02:55 PM) cpw: ok
(2:03:02 PM) cpw: i'll grab r5 from the wiki then
(2:03:03 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: sillyfilly_4rz0
(2:03:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: so wheat > bread dough > furnace(bread dough) > bread?
(2:04:21 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: oh man... i kinda want to make a food mod now..
(2:04:50 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i watch a 2 guys who do a minecraft lets play, and one of them doesnt eat meat IRL, so he doesnt in MC
(2:05:09 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: so he has to live on bread, cake, and melons, and the occational apple
(2:05:37 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: it be cool to make a mod centered around farming / food just for them
(2:05:40 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm
(2:14:42 PM) Silentspy: yea DV8FromTheWorld 
(2:15:04 PM) Silentspy: got another idea in my head too now
(2:15:20 PM) Silentspy: make the watermelon drop the block itself, and you have to craft the watermelon to get slices
(2:15:26 PM) Silentspy: just makes the farming a bit more complicated and fun
(2:16:08 PM) Silentspy: unless you can do that with silk touch already ofc
(2:20:29 PM) Silentspy: DV8FromTheWorld: if you wanna make a food mod by all means i recommend you to do it
(2:20:37 PM) Silentspy: the current ones have content which it shouldnt have.
(2:25:34 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm
(2:25:40 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the problem is actually doing it :D
(2:25:44 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: no idea where to start
(2:25:52 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: silentspy, i do have an idea for you
(2:26:09 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: when you grow the melon, you get the whole melon like you said
(2:26:22 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: but instead of just putting it in the crafting bench and getting melon slice out
(2:26:43 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: you put it in the crafting bench with a knife, kinda like how you can put any block with a saw from RP
(2:26:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and get panels
(2:27:06 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: so melon, plus knife, = slices
(2:27:17 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and the knife doesnt get used up, it has a durability
(2:27:32 PM) JoneK: Redpower addon ..
(2:27:38 PM) JoneK: ouh wait.. :( snap... no api
(2:27:42 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: lol
(2:27:51 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: personally, i dont want to be cutting my melons with a saw
(2:28:00 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: you know.. that knife idea could be used in the food mod
(2:28:02 PM) JoneK: true enoufhghfh
(2:28:07 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: if you had other fruits like say..
(2:28:08 PM) allaryin: heh hacksaw watermelon
(2:28:11 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: apples and bananas
(2:28:12 PM) allaryin: is a good project codename
(2:28:13 PM) Silentspy: hmm good idea DV8FromTheWorld :P
(2:28:14 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: cut them up
(2:28:22 PM) Silentspy: and you can use the knife as a melee weapon too?
(2:28:26 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: put in a (insert device name here)
(2:28:27 PM) JoneK: PinaColada
(2:28:29 PM) Silentspy: its really quick haha
(2:28:35 PM) allaryin: pinacolada = tropicraft
(2:28:37 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and make another kidna of food
(2:28:47 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: like a smoothie or somethign
(2:28:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:28:56 PM) allaryin: pam's mods & trees++ both add a lot of raw fruits
(2:29:03 PM) JoneK: Yeah it is in it.. :( I just hate tropicraft COS! it makes another realm... :( 
(2:29:07 PM) allaryin: trees++ has smoothie recipe
(2:29:12 PM) JoneK: It should make a massive biome
(2:29:20 PM) allaryin: my daughter is the master of minecraft smoothies
(2:29:27 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: eh.. im looking for something a bit less invasive
(2:29:28 PM) allaryin: glass cup + 2 fruit + snowball
(2:29:34 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm
(2:29:39 PM) allaryin: you should be able to turn off most of the biomes iirc
(2:29:40 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i just thought of something else
(2:29:57 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: around here we have something called "snow cream"
(2:30:09 PM) JoneK: Well =) back to DayZ
(2:30:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: baically you take fresh snow, and make icecream from it
(2:30:33 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: you could do something similar with snowballs, milk, and some type of flavoring
(2:30:44 PM) allaryin: the world needs more milk recipes
(2:30:46 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: you could do chocolate to start, but we need something for vanilla
(2:30:49 PM) allaryin: i'm sick of milk being so useless ;)
(2:30:52 PM) Silentspy: http://puu.sh/CD7X
(2:30:56 PM) Silentspy: which is the best bread dough?
(2:30:57 PM) allaryin: don't know of any mod that adds vanilla beans
(2:31:11 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm, if i implemented strawberries, then you could get strawberry icecream
(2:31:23 PM) allaryin: strawberries are interesting, they grow as a ground cover
(2:31:24 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the lesser
(2:31:25 PM) vidplace7|work: :O
(2:31:28 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: on the left
(2:31:37 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: exactly.
(2:31:54 PM) JoneK: =D Trololo .. I just saw the "Scanining for lan Worlds" in the latest snapshot..
(2:31:59 PM) JoneK: A cool animation
(2:32:12 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: they actually would need to be like sugar came
(2:32:14 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: cane*
(2:32:20 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: in that they need to be touching water
(2:32:25 PM) allaryin: ?
(2:32:26 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the block they are on
(2:32:36 PM) allaryin: irl strawberries rot easy
(2:32:40 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yes
(2:32:41 PM) vidplace7|work: allaryin: could you do anything with bananpocalypse?
(2:32:43 PM) allaryin: hence the name "straw" berry
(2:32:49 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: they cant be in snow biomes nor desert
(2:32:51 PM) JoneK is now known as JoneDayZ
(2:33:08 PM) allaryin: they traditionally grew on mats of dry straw to keep them from rotting on the dirt
(2:33:15 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yep
(2:33:25 PM) allaryin: vid: you left 3 seconds before i came to a conclusion
(2:33:30 PM) Didz: Silentspy, make a texture that doesn't have the bread's "dimples" on the top
(2:33:38 PM) allaryin: and that conclusion was that a) you didn't give me all the code, and b) it's a lost cause ;)
(2:33:57 PM) cpw: wrcbe done
(2:34:00 PM) allaryin: woo
(2:34:02 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: well, around here we plan the straw berries into the ground, but we put a black tarp over them
(2:34:09 PM) allaryin: nod, same principle
(2:34:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and poke wholes in the tarp
(2:34:12 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: for rain
(2:34:18 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and the black tarp is for heat
(2:34:20 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:34:26 PM) Didz: it's a tarp
(2:34:28 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the tarp keeps water and heat in
(2:34:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: lol didz
(2:34:48 PM) allaryin: dv8: have you seen inficraft's berry bushes?
(2:34:58 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: nope, im seriously behind on my mods.
(2:35:07 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i actually need to update simple ores in a sec
(2:35:08 PM) Didz: i'd like to be able to farm peas and carrots in mc for some reason
(2:35:09 PM) allaryin: i <3 them so much it hurts the rest of the mod is unusable
(2:35:11 PM) allaryin: please
(2:35:16 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: didz, thats a cool idea
(2:35:19 PM) allaryin: i need to add simpleores to server i launched last night :P
(2:35:22 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: take peas and carrots
(2:35:23 PM) allaryin: carrots would rule
(2:35:25 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: maybe even corn
(2:35:30 PM) Didz: and potatos!
(2:35:31 PM) allaryin: basic root crops are good
(2:35:33 PM) allaryin: nod
(2:35:36 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and take some wheat/bread
(2:35:41 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and make a shepards pie
(2:35:41 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:35:46 PM) Didz: hehe
(2:35:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: you might need some meat in there
(2:35:52 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: totally forgot about that :P
(2:35:54 PM) allaryin: ...
(2:35:59 PM) allaryin: mutton. WHY.
(2:36:03 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ?
(2:36:05 PM) allaryin: why is no sheepies eatable?
(2:36:09 PM) Didz: I'd like sausages from pig meat too...
(2:36:25 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i have an idea
(2:36:30 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: take the porkchap
(2:36:33 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: cop*
(2:36:42 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and put it in the crafting bench
(2:36:46 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: use a knife
(2:36:58 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: get 3 bacon/ 1 porkchop
(2:37:04 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ?
(2:37:07 PM) allaryin: macerate meat = ground pork/beef. :P
(2:37:16 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: IC2 addon
(2:37:27 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: make hamburgers
(2:37:37 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: pulled pork sandwiches
(2:38:03 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hm.. should there be a "grill" to then?
(2:38:12 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: make it run on charcoal!
(2:38:14 PM) allaryin: sigh
(2:38:21 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: give an actual reason for charcoal
(2:38:35 PM) allaryin: charcoal = gasmask filters in my evil evil plan ;)
(2:38:42 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: O.o
(2:39:01 PM) ***DV8FromTheWorld seriously wants to do this now LO
(2:39:03 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :P*
(2:39:09 PM) allaryin: hamburgers or gasmasks?
(2:39:16 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the food mod in general
(2:39:40 PM) allaryin: i like berries++ in principle, i just wish the bukkit port worked for me
(2:40:15 PM) vidplace7|work: allaryin: why is it a "lost cause"
(2:40:35 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: what is a lost cause?
(2:40:54 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hm.. need tomatos
(2:40:57 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: make a blt
(2:41:06 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: so also need lettuce :D
(2:41:09 PM) Didz: you forgot the lettuce a-
(2:41:10 PM) Didz: yeah
(2:41:22 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm, if we get enough veggies
(2:41:30 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: would could do multiple types of salad
(2:41:34 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: like a normal salad
(2:41:39 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and fish salad
(2:41:43 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and chicken salad
(2:42:28 PM) vidplace7|work: http://fvmc.us:8123
(2:42:29 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm, might also want to look into something like IC2 crop integrationi
(2:42:34 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: like to work with the crop sticks
(2:43:18 PM) allaryin: see... at that point, you're looking at something that IS as world-altering as trees++
(2:43:53 PM) allaryin: without i guess putting redwoods through the middle of volcanos
(2:44:32 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: wait
(2:44:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: why is that world altering?
(2:44:53 PM) allaryin: do you want this plethora of new plantlife to be naturally occurring?
(2:45:01 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm..
(2:45:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: not sure.
(2:45:13 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: havent got that far.
(2:45:16 PM) allaryin: the one thing i despise about ic2 crops is that you HAVE to crossbreed and pray to get the interesting stuff
(2:45:41 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: personally, i dont want to have these things consuming the enitire world
(2:45:47 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: but they need to grow somewhere..
(2:45:49 PM) allaryin: even forestry bees spawn in interesting locations and have a sane path to breed
(2:45:55 PM) allaryin: yup
(2:45:55 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: or have some way to get the seeds
(2:46:05 PM) allaryin: and adding them as a random drop from grass is dumb
(2:46:16 PM) allaryin: oh what was the mod...
(2:46:21 PM) allaryin: something adds barley grass
(2:46:22 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: tropical fruits can grow in the jungle
(2:46:32 PM) allaryin: sure, those are new tree types probably ;)
(2:46:43 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: well, probably not
(2:46:53 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: you can just extend the current code
(2:46:58 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and make them grow on the trees
(2:47:10 PM) allaryin: so regular jungle trees grow bananas and coconuts on the same tree? o.O
(2:47:17 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: no
(2:47:21 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: well
(2:47:29 PM) allaryin: do they ever regrow?
(2:47:33 PM) Maeyanie: Sure, why not, apples grow on every tree.
(2:47:35 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: give me a sec to thing.
(2:47:40 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: think*
(2:47:40 PM) allaryin: i hate the apple mechanic :P
(2:47:44 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: agreed.
(2:47:44 PM) ***Maeyanie too.
(2:47:53 PM) allaryin: do they grow on every tree?
(2:47:56 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i think something that is more.. how you say... controlled.
(2:47:58 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: would be better
(2:48:01 PM) allaryin: i thought only the first two types
(2:48:06 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: like an actually APPLE tree
(2:48:08 PM) allaryin: not the pines or jungle trees
(2:48:14 PM) allaryin: trees++ has apple trees.
(2:48:20 PM) allaryin: they look weird compared to the rest, but they work
(2:48:21 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm.. pineapple trees..
(2:48:23 PM) Maeyanie: Well, point is, there isn't apple trees. Every tree is an apple tree.
(2:48:24 PM) allaryin: laugh
(2:48:25 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: banana trees.
(2:48:28 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: apple trees.
(2:48:30 PM) Maeyanie: Which is... wrong.
(2:48:33 PM) allaryin: yes
(2:48:39 PM) allaryin: vanilla apple mechanics are braindead
(2:49:02 PM) Maeyanie: Now, the real trick will be, doing this without eating a gazillion block IDs, the way... what was that mod...
(2:49:08 PM) allaryin: it's up there with not being able to eat sheep and pumpkins ;)
(2:49:25 PM) cpw: pams mods
(2:49:34 PM) allaryin: pam adds a TON of food types
(2:49:55 PM) Maeyanie: Yeah, that's the one.
(2:49:59 PM) allaryin: inficraft eats a gazillion block id's ;)
(2:50:06 PM) allaryin: or well, item id's
(2:50:07 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yea
(2:50:08 PM) cpw: good mods. i like the simple one. it's simple. it only adds a half dozen or so things.
(2:50:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i dont want to do that
(2:50:24 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: woops
(2:50:25 PM) allaryin: 5 or 6 would be sufficient to do a LOT
(2:50:26 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i mean
(2:50:31 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i dont want to take up alot of IDS
(2:50:36 PM) Maeyanie: cpw got it though, plants and more, that's the one I was thinking about. :)
(2:50:39 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i want to make it fairly simple
(2:50:51 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: but i want to add lots of foods
(2:50:56 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: MC is so building based
(2:51:05 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: our poor characters are mal nurished
(2:51:07 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:51:18 PM) allaryin: mine eat walnut salads and drink orange juice ;)
(2:51:26 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: AWESOME
(2:51:35 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: a juicer machive
(2:51:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: for apples
(2:51:40 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: oranges
(2:51:44 PM) allaryin: forestry ;)
(2:51:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and all kinds of fruits
(2:51:50 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: forestry?
(2:52:01 PM) Maeyanie: IC2 compressor could do the job...
(2:52:09 PM) allaryin: forestry can mush apples up into bc liquid
(2:52:22 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yes, but some people dont play with IC2
(2:52:28 PM) Maeyanie: True
(2:52:29 PM) allaryin: yes, but those people are silly
(2:52:29 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and quite honestly
(2:52:37 PM) allaryin: ;)
(2:52:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i dotn want to crush fruit to drink
(2:52:44 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: with soemthing i crust ores with
(2:52:44 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:52:48 PM) allaryin: heh
(2:52:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: crush
(2:52:49 PM) Maeyanie: Well, some servers just aren't industrial-themed. And they need to eat too. :)
(2:52:54 PM) allaryin: stop cooking beef in your blast furnace? :P
(2:52:59 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: allaryin
(2:53:04 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: didnt you see what i said?
(2:53:08 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: a "grill"
(2:53:11 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: running on charcoal
(2:53:11 PM) allaryin: yeah, nod
(2:53:12 PM) vidplace7|work: yeah! my server is apocalypse themed :P
(2:53:22 PM) allaryin: charcoal grill = terrafirmacraft?
(2:53:26 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: will NOT work with coal
(2:53:29 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: only charcoal
(2:53:39 PM) allaryin: sure. coal is industrial, charcoal is residential
(2:53:44 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: exactly.
(2:53:54 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: so we are giving use to charcoal, milk,
(2:53:58 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: more for wheat
(2:54:06 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i really need to grab this log
(2:54:09 PM) allaryin: heh
(2:54:09 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: of this irc
(2:54:15 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ima forget this stuff
(2:54:17 PM) allaryin: ;)
(2:54:18 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: this is like.. gold
(2:54:33 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and im going to do something that i have always wanted to do
(2:54:33 PM) Nilinking: whats gold? hi guys XD
(2:54:39 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: make an MC mod, that is open source
(2:54:41 PM) allaryin: about 2048 emc
(2:55:00 PM) Nilinking: oh, imma grab that too lol
(2:55:05 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: LD
(2:55:06 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ::D
(2:55:23 PM) Maeyanie: DV8FromTheWorld: Under a special provision, that if Tekkit uses it, they have to pay  for each download? :p
(2:55:31 PM) allaryin: mmm
(2:55:36 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yes
(2:55:36 PM) allaryin: charging teh tekkits
(2:55:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:55:40 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: well... idk
(2:55:47 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the people that inspired me to make the mod
(2:55:53 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: use tekkit
(2:56:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i would prefer that they get to use the mod, than not (the people that inspired me)
(2:56:10 PM) Maeyanie: Yeah, was just referring to something smb said.
(2:56:18 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yea i remember
(2:56:18 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:56:21 PM) Maeyanie: :)
(2:56:29 PM) allaryin: tree crops, root crops, grasses/groundcover, bamboo types
(2:56:30 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: if it wasnt for them using tekkit right now, i would
(2:56:31 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:56:36 PM) allaryin: ic2 crop support as a separate addon
(2:56:44 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yes allaryin
(2:56:51 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: oh crap..
(2:56:56 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i just thought of something..
(2:56:57 PM) Nilinking: btw guys, anyone who wants to gimme a hand with some packets on fml? i dont know if im doing they right
(2:57:14 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: you cant keep food in a chest O.o
(2:57:20 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: you need.. a fridge!
(2:57:21 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:57:25 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yes? no?
(2:57:32 PM) allaryin: ... refrigeration is dangerous
(2:57:42 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: define
(2:57:43 PM) Maeyanie: That'd be kinda annoying... and actually a pain to code.
(2:57:49 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm, ok
(2:57:51 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: strike that
(2:57:53 PM) allaryin: huge supply chain, not a lot of benefit
(2:57:54 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: just an idea
(2:58:08 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: probably would be stupid anyways
(2:58:09 PM) allaryin: but iceboxes as food-only chests? shrug
(2:58:14 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: people are used to chests
(2:58:16 PM) allaryin: just a large box that can hold food items
(2:58:18 PM) Maeyanie: That could work.
(2:58:24 PM) Nilinking: dv8 thats actually nice
(2:58:25 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: interesting
(2:58:36 PM) Nilinking: its a good idea for realism
(2:58:47 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i do need something like an icebox for the salads and icecream and milkshakes/smoothies
(2:58:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: so...
(2:58:49 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(2:58:53 PM) allaryin: heh
(2:59:07 PM) allaryin: doubling up on the icebox as a crafting machine is interesting
(2:59:16 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hm?
(2:59:17 PM) allaryin: requiring certain things to set in the fridge for X ticks
(2:59:30 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ah to like freeze them?
(2:59:34 PM) allaryin: sure
(2:59:41 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm, something similar for the grill
(2:59:49 PM) allaryin: nod
(2:59:55 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i think that instead of doing it like a furnace with only 1 slot at a time
(2:59:57 PM) allaryin: grill processes 3x3 grid of food items at once ;)
(3:00:01 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: have maybe.. 4 or 5
(3:00:04 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: or 3x3
(3:00:04 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(3:00:07 PM) allaryin: with hot and cold spots :P
(3:00:08 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: that makes more sense
(3:00:15 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: eh.. idk about that
(3:00:15 PM) Nilinking: your idea should be done adding a duration bar to the food items and make it decrease x amount every xticks
(3:00:28 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: nilink
(3:00:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i was thinking about that for like vegies and fruits
(3:00:44 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and if you have them in the icebox
(3:00:46 PM) colk: Intresting right clicking on a redpower 2 computer with industrial craft 2 causes an instant disconnect for the client
(3:00:47 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: they last longer
(3:01:11 PM) Nilinking: course, its an wesome idea
(3:01:13 PM) allaryin: exception anywhere?
(3:01:24 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: huh?
(3:01:31 PM) allaryin: colk
(3:01:36 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: oh k
(3:01:44 PM) allaryin: dv8: the concept of food rotting is kind of scary though in a game for hoarders
(3:01:55 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: lol
(3:01:57 PM) colk: Yeah let me pull it
(3:02:04 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ill make it a config option?
(3:02:19 PM) allaryin: possibly a lot of expensive code for such a small effect
(3:02:23 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: alot of work for a config turnoff
(3:02:34 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yea. but i feel its nessesary
(3:02:41 PM) allaryin: also - chunk loading.
(3:02:43 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i wont have it anytime near the beginning
(3:02:48 PM) allaryin: store your food in an unused chunk, problem solved.
(3:02:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: but it will be later
(3:02:54 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm
(3:02:57 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: good point
(3:03:00 PM) allaryin: heck, nether fridge :)
(3:03:02 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: we will see how it goes.
(3:03:12 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: lol
(3:03:22 PM) Maeyanie: Unless it decays by time difference instead of decreasing each X ticks.
(3:03:36 PM) Nilinking: dv8 i think a lot of work only for a config is absolutely necesary... because congigs make your mod flexible to diferent likings
(3:03:39 PM) allaryin: maybe it's just a question of ingredient grade
(3:03:43 PM) Maeyanie: So, soon as the chunk gets loaded again, poof!
(3:03:45 PM) allaryin: S->A->B->C->D
(3:03:49 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: agreed nikin
(3:03:54 PM) allaryin: never rot to uselessness
(3:04:04 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: well
(3:04:04 PM) allaryin: but D-grade food isn't as valuable
(3:04:06 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: maybe this
(3:04:16 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: D-food is on the same level as zombie meat?
(3:04:24 PM) allaryin: well, not poisonous, but sure
(3:04:28 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: why not
(3:04:37 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: have you ever eaten a rotten fruit
(3:04:37 PM) allaryin: don't penalize people for downloading your mod
(3:04:47 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i got sick for 2 weeks that way :o
(3:04:48 PM) allaryin: not rotten, just... questionable ;)
(3:04:55 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: O.o?
(3:05:02 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: no i think we are on 2 different pages
(3:05:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: zombie food just takes your hunger down some
(3:05:15 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: it gives you hunger
(3:05:21 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and you use it
(3:05:24 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: to get full hunger
(3:05:28 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: recharge health
(3:05:35 PM) Nilinking: i allways eat zombie meat XD its like a hobbie hahahaha
(3:05:36 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: then it takes your hunger down to half
(3:05:41 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: thats how zombie meat works
(3:05:52 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i think it should be the same for grade D food
(3:06:02 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: it would just make sense.
(3:06:39 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: maybe it should also be a config option.  It would only work when the decay option is enabled ofcourse
(3:06:40 PM) allaryin: ... you know
(3:06:50 PM) allaryin: there's the whole visible/invisible hunger meter thing
(3:07:02 PM) allaryin: D-grade food could just have zero invisible nourishment
(3:07:16 PM) allaryin: satisfaction? what do they call it?
(3:07:21 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: huh?
(3:07:23 PM) Maeyanie: Satiation, or some such
(3:07:29 PM) Maeyanie: Not a bad idea.
(3:08:14 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: satiation?
(3:08:32 PM) allaryin: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Hunger
(3:08:33 PM) allaryin: saturation
(3:08:44 PM) Maeyanie: Well, we were both close :)
(3:11:25 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: wait..
(3:11:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: its like the satisfaction of being full,, right?
(3:12:05 PM) Maeyanie: Basically, yeah, it's the time after eating until you start getting hungry again.
(3:12:19 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm
(3:12:27 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: well, heres what i think would happen
(3:13:11 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: Grade D gives no "full effect" and also a 50% chance of poison, which is dirrectly inbetween the poison fact for raw chicken and zombie meat
(3:13:46 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: Grade C food would give no "Full effect" but would not cause any poison effect
(3:13:59 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: so it would only help your food meter
(3:14:20 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: not sure what to do with a-b
(3:14:27 PM) Maeyanie: Well, it'll take some testing to balance everything, but that can all be later.
(3:14:32 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: exactl
(3:14:51 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: for now i need the code supporting the recipes, the items, the textures, the food amounts
(3:14:53 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ect
(3:15:15 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: quite honestly, as much as i want to do this alone, i dont really know where to start..
(3:15:15 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :\
(3:15:18 PM) Maeyanie: Probably a lot of testing, since you want it to be useful/non-annoying without being overpowered.
(3:15:27 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yea.
(3:20:49 PM) allaryin: nod. probably biggest problem most "cool" mods suffer from is a fatal lack of balance
(3:21:31 PM) allaryin: whether it's turning gunpowder into diamonds or solar farms that outproduce nuke plants or trees that produce 20 apples an hour...
(3:22:41 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i dont want the apples thing
(3:22:47 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: personally, if i do make some kind of trees
(3:22:51 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: to grow fruit
(3:22:57 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: that will take a long time to grow
(3:23:09 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and will not grow with bonemeal
(3:23:28 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: if anything, i might make a recipe to use bonemeal, to turn it into a fertlizer
(3:23:30 PM) allaryin: plz don't implement your own fertilizer
(3:23:35 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: LLLLLLLLLLLLLOL
(3:23:37 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: k nty
(3:23:43 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: nvm :D
(3:23:53 PM) allaryin: forestry and ic2 both have "fertilizer" already
(3:24:01 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: oh really?
(3:24:02 PM) allaryin: plus bonemeal
(3:24:02 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: nvm them
(3:24:14 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ok, fertilizer is out
(3:24:25 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: but still, i dont want stuff to use bonemeal
(3:24:28 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: its cheap >.>
(3:24:40 PM) allaryin: of course
(3:24:51 PM) colk: Allaryin http://pastebin.com/QdVDzxyN is the error (this also kicks the person)

(3:25:36 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: cant stop listening to that
(3:26:35 PM) allaryin: laugh
(3:27:53 PM) allaryin: colk: do you see an exception on the client? not really sure what to make of it - i'm using all of those mods except the mumble one, but yeah
(3:27:58 PM) allaryin: is that ic2 1.95b?
(3:28:45 PM) colk: Yes
(3:28:50 PM) colk: Or its supposed to be
(3:29:09 PM) colk: Server side its r2 
(3:29:31 PM) allaryin: and this doesn't happen with ic2 turned off?
(3:30:13 PM) colk: Its the industrialcraft 2 crops
(3:30:18 PM) colk: That cause it
(3:30:27 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hey
(3:30:32 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: this is stupid
(3:30:34 PM) allaryin: ic2 crops are buggy as crap right now i think
(3:30:41 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: but what other foods are mushrooms a big part of?
(3:30:57 PM) allaryin: i had to move ic2 into my server jar to keep them from acting weirdly
(3:31:06 PM) allaryin: mushrooms are used in sauces and pastes
(3:31:21 PM) allaryin: as a condiment or ingredient in salads
(3:31:24 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hm
(3:31:31 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: something i can implement?
(3:31:46 PM) allaryin: soups.
(3:31:49 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: they are only used in the mushroom soup recipe
(3:31:51 PM) colk: The thing is muckk says moving it into jar won't help
(3:31:52 PM) allaryin: yeah
(3:31:55 PM) allaryin: :(
(3:32:18 PM) allaryin: i bootstrapped new server last night and bred wheat+wheat = sugarcane
(3:32:34 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: O.o
(3:32:39 PM) allaryin: without ic2 in the server jar, it exploded iirc
(3:32:57 PM) ***allaryin is a fan of ic2 crops, not a fan of the breeding mechanic
(3:33:05 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: its cool.
(3:33:07 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: but
(3:33:16 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the fact that you can ONLY get alot of stuff that wy
(3:33:17 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ...
(3:33:20 PM) allaryin: the farm where the cane grew is like 20m from my sugarcane pond :P
(3:33:20 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: way*
(3:33:31 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: lol
(3:34:04 PM) allaryin: dude.
(3:34:06 PM) allaryin: cheese.
(3:34:08 PM) allaryin: qed.
(3:34:22 PM) allaryin: also vegetable oil
(3:34:47 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: cheese yes
(3:34:58 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: what what would you use vegtable oil for?
(3:35:02 PM) allaryin: FRYING.
(3:35:13 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: mind you, im trying not to get to complicated..
(3:35:29 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm... i wonder..
(3:35:30 PM) allaryin: 3rd machine. you have icebox, you have grill, you have fryer :)
(3:35:43 PM) allaryin: or maybe frying could happen on the grilltop
(3:35:44 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: maybe instead of putting this all into 1 mod
(3:35:49 PM) allaryin: 3 mods
(3:35:53 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: exactly
(3:35:58 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the main one
(3:36:00 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the grill section
(3:36:05 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: the frying section
(3:36:36 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: that way people dont have to have lots of stuff they dont want
(3:36:40 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: they can pick what they want
(3:36:53 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: omg... i just thought of something..
(3:37:00 PM) allaryin: the world needs a better ore mod. one with config options for ALL THE METALS.
(3:37:04 PM) allaryin: same deal here
(3:37:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: allaryin
(3:37:14 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: 1 moment
(3:37:17 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ive got something for you to read
(3:37:18 PM) allaryin: afk work :P
(3:37:43 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: http://www.mod-buildcraft.com/forums/topic/forge-ore-dictionary-ore-better-basic-ore-support/
(3:37:45 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: read^
(3:38:51 PM) allaryin: b
(3:40:25 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: Maeyaine
(3:40:29 PM) allaryin: nod
(3:40:39 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: do you know if its possible to get multiple blocks into 1 block
(3:40:44 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: when they arent present?
(3:40:52 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: like addons use the same block id?
(3:40:59 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: like the main part of the mod use id x
(3:41:02 PM) allaryin: ... aren't present?
(3:41:08 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and an addon to the mod use id x:2
(3:41:27 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and another addon use id X:3
(3:41:30 PM) allaryin: well, if core mod is required for addon to function it should be fine i'd think
(3:41:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: right right.
(3:41:49 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: allaryin
(3:41:54 PM) allaryin: since you're the one controlling your metadata, should be fine i'd think?
(3:41:55 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: how much knowledge do you have on coding?
(3:42:00 PM) allaryin: "on coding?"
(3:42:14 PM) allaryin: i learned pascal in 1989?
(3:42:24 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: im basically asking if you want to workon this with me.
(3:42:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: either way its going to be open source
(3:42:42 PM) allaryin: nod
(3:42:45 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: so you could drop in if you felt like it
(3:42:56 PM) allaryin: i am probably interested
(3:42:58 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: just figured i would drop the invitation :D
(3:43:10 PM) allaryin: give me time to build up evil evil plan before i spring it
(3:43:16 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: lol
(3:43:25 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i have only 1 fear
(3:43:39 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i have next-to-no coding experience besides 2 plugins and porting
(3:43:44 PM) allaryin: heh
(3:43:49 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: just dont want someone to dominate over me :P
(3:44:02 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: friends co-help cool
(3:44:14 PM) allaryin: honestly, i don't expect this will be terribly complicated. more headaches from just organizing it
(3:44:22 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: agreed,
(3:44:22 PM) allaryin: the thing i've got no idea on is client-side stuff
(3:44:34 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm k
(3:45:03 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: got to do ssp before smp
(3:45:04 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :P
(3:45:17 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i want to code with the idea of smp
(3:45:21 PM) allaryin: i can write you a cross-server chat plugin... but i've not the first idea on minecraft's gui's and block texturing voodoo
(3:45:22 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i dont like ssp only mods
(3:45:32 PM) allaryin: ssp-only is a thing of the past
(3:45:37 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: agreed.
(3:45:38 PM) allaryin: if you don't get multiplayer you rot and are forgotten
(3:45:50 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: unless you are logistics pipes
(3:45:50 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :D
(3:46:14 PM) allaryin: sure, thaumcraft, logistics pipes... a handful of others
(3:46:23 PM) allaryin: but they're all suffering from a lack of smp
(3:46:28 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: only because they are HUGE
(3:46:36 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: like, amazing.
(3:46:50 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: logistics pipes is currently working toward smp
(3:46:52 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: and bukkit
(3:47:23 PM) allaryin: nod
(3:47:27 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i dont like eclipse
(3:47:34 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i cant figure out how to do Git from it
(3:47:37 PM) allaryin: heh
(3:47:39 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: >.>
(3:47:44 PM) allaryin: i don't like doing scm from my ide
(3:47:58 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: im thinking about doing it manually
(3:48:02 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: outside of the IDE
(3:48:02 PM) allaryin: nod, is what i do
(3:48:07 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: its what i used to do
(3:48:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i think ima do that.
(3:48:13 PM) allaryin: tortoise has a decent git plugin
(3:48:18 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i wonder..
(3:48:29 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: has anyone ever done there coding inside dropbox?
(3:48:32 PM) allaryin: still have to install msysgit separately, but it works
(3:48:38 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: like point your workspace to dropbox
(3:48:40 PM) allaryin: dropbox is not source control
(3:48:45 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: no no
(3:48:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i know that
(3:48:55 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: im just wondering if anyone has ever done it
(3:48:58 PM) allaryin: it's just a slow network drive
(3:49:04 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i know mate.
(3:49:10 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i plan to use github, freaking love,
(3:49:14 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: it*
(3:49:38 PM) allaryin: my dropbox has a clone of my git client/server config repo
(3:49:46 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: thats smart
(3:49:55 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: ok, let me see if i can get this setup
(3:49:56 PM) allaryin: it doesn't like reading and writing at the same time though
(3:50:02 PM) allaryin: i have to turn off sync when working
(3:50:04 PM) allaryin: sometimes
(3:50:07 PM) allaryin: sometimes it works fine
(3:52:43 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hmm
(3:52:48 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: now the hard part...
(3:52:51 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: a name for the mod..
(3:52:53 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: :o
(3:53:00 PM) allaryin: hacksaw watermelon
(3:53:06 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: um wow
(3:53:08 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i
(3:53:09 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: wow
(3:53:11 PM) allaryin: backlog :P
(3:53:12 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i kinda like that
(3:53:23 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: hacksaw watermelin
(3:53:27 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: melon*
(3:53:27 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: D:
(3:53:39 PM) allaryin: random codenames are the best until it matters
(3:53:45 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: agreed.
(3:53:50 PM) allaryin: skips the arguing and deliberating
(3:53:55 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: yep
(3:58:57 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: but first
(3:59:04 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: something that i promised to do over a month ago
(3:59:09 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: i need to port classcraft
(3:59:47 PM) allaryin: ;)
(4:00:13 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: oh this is interesting

(4:00:31 PM) DV8FromTheWorld: its in class craft
