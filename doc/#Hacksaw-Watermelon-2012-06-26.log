[05:01.33] <@allaryin> oy.
[05:01.52] <DV8FromTheWorld> o my god
[05:01.59] * allaryin was at work until 1:30 last night and then got sick after getting home
[05:02.00] <DV8FromTheWorld> your ALIVE
[05:02.04] <@allaryin> i feel like a bucket of puke
[05:02.07] <DV8FromTheWorld> :\
[05:02.13] <@allaryin> alive is a strong word
[05:02.14] <DV8FromTheWorld> that really sucks
[05:02.17] <DV8FromTheWorld> lol
[05:02.22] <DV8FromTheWorld> how about not dead?
[05:02.36] <@allaryin> nod
[05:02.45] <DV8FromTheWorld> anyways, i contacted that guy that i wanted to make the mod for
[05:02.48] <@allaryin> umm, as far as multiplayer code editing
[05:02.51] <DV8FromTheWorld> i asked him about juicing
[05:02.59] <DV8FromTheWorld> thought you might want to read it
[05:03.05] <@allaryin> that's called source control
[05:03.18] <DV8FromTheWorld> yea, i thought so
[05:03.22] <DV8FromTheWorld> basically git
[05:03.26] <DV8FromTheWorld> what i meant was like..
[05:03.36] <DV8FromTheWorld> while im typing code, you could see me typing
[05:03.42] <DV8FromTheWorld> like the new commercial from google
[05:03.50] <DV8FromTheWorld> about them writing a song together
[05:03.58] <DV8FromTheWorld> and they are both typing on the same document together
[05:04.01] <DV8FromTheWorld> anyways..
[05:04.10] <@allaryin> only way i've ever done it before was screen sharing or something
[05:04.29] <DV8FromTheWorld> yea
[05:04.31] <DV8FromTheWorld> thats what i thought
[05:04.44] <DV8FromTheWorld> anyways, it wasnt something i planned to use probably, it was just an idea
[05:04.46] <DV8FromTheWorld> anyways
[05:05.01] <DV8FromTheWorld> here is what the guy (Kwantonium/quantonium) said
[05:05.03] <DV8FromTheWorld> +http://pastebin.com/E69GYqvv,
[05:05.45] <DV8FromTheWorld> that fruit hes talking about
[05:05.47] <DV8FromTheWorld> ive never heard of it
[05:05.51] <DV8FromTheWorld> but googling it
[05:05.51] <GadgetTvMan> Is he a fruit juice expert?
[05:05.54] <DV8FromTheWorld> omfg, its awesome
[05:06.05] <DV8FromTheWorld> he is a vegen
[05:06.15] <GadgetTvMan> same thing.
[05:06.16] <DV8FromTheWorld> so in his videos, he plays not eating meat
[05:06.24] <DV8FromTheWorld> IE: apples, melons and bread only
[05:06.33] <DV8FromTheWorld> hence, why i wanted to make the mod
[05:06.34] <GadgetTvMan> Oh, that YT guy.
[05:06.39] <@allaryin> durians are cool
[05:06.39] <DV8FromTheWorld> ?
[05:06.49] <@allaryin> and yeah, they're an se asian thing
[05:06.54] <DV8FromTheWorld> ah ok
[05:07.01] <DV8FromTheWorld> i think it would go well with the knife thing
[05:07.20] <DV8FromTheWorld> but stuff like that and coconuts would take more out of the knife durability that other stuff
[05:07.27] <DV8FromTheWorld> like carrots, apples melonds
[05:07.29] <DV8FromTheWorld> melons*
[05:07.32] <DV8FromTheWorld> ect..
[05:07.35] <GadgetTvMan> just wondering, will the mod have a stove in it?
[05:07.41] <@allaryin> yes
[05:07.43] <DV8FromTheWorld> yea
[05:07.49] <@allaryin> we're thinking a grilltop
[05:07.54] <DV8FromTheWorld> well wait
[05:08.03] <DV8FromTheWorld> a grilltop and a stove are 2 different things.
[05:08.09] <@allaryin> nod
[05:08.10] <DV8FromTheWorld> if we did something like a real stove
[05:08.15] <@allaryin> sorry - game already has "stoves"
[05:08.20] <DV8FromTheWorld> fuck the furnace
[05:08.24] <@allaryin> ;)
[05:08.28] <DV8FromTheWorld> anyways,
[05:08.35] <DV8FromTheWorld> are we going to do something with baking?
[05:08.45] <DV8FromTheWorld> personally, cakes made from raw stuff? O.o
[05:08.52] <GadgetTvMan> i already sorta started using techne for the stove...
[05:09.13] <DV8FromTheWorld> gadget, just keep experiementing with techne
[05:09.25] <DV8FromTheWorld> try to make a grill
[05:09.34] <DV8FromTheWorld> like... a charcoal grill
[05:09.52] <GadgetTvMan> ok.
[05:10.09] <DV8FromTheWorld> +http://www.2fatpolocksbbq.com/images/grill.jpg,
[05:10.13] <DV8FromTheWorld> like that maybe?
[05:10.21] <DV8FromTheWorld> then we can have the grill top open also
[05:10.22] <DV8FromTheWorld> :D
[05:10.22] <@allaryin> that's what i kind of thought we were talking
[05:10.31] <GadgetTvMan> i have one in mind.
[05:10.34] <DV8FromTheWorld> that != a stove
[05:10.45] <GadgetTvMan> But, should i put my techne stove file in dropbox?
[05:10.48] <DV8FromTheWorld> +http://appliancerepairinelcajonca.com/images/ge_30_gas_stove_2.JPG,
[05:10.49] <DV8FromTheWorld> stove
[05:10.53] <DV8FromTheWorld> yes gadget
[05:11.09] <GadgetTvMan> lol, that pic is what the stove is based off.
[05:11.16] <DV8FromTheWorld> seriously?
[05:11.19] <DV8FromTheWorld> that pic?
[05:11.20] <DV8FromTheWorld> XD
[05:11.23] <GadgetTvMan> well, in my minds eye.
[05:11.26] <DV8FromTheWorld> mm
[05:11.38] <GadgetTvMan> btw, the stove im making isnt done IMO..
[05:11.43] <DV8FromTheWorld> im thinking we could do something for the cook top on top
[05:11.54] <DV8FromTheWorld> and use it also for baking
[05:11.57] <DV8FromTheWorld> like a real stove
[05:12.06] <DV8FromTheWorld> hmm...
[05:12.24] <@allaryin> what is techne?
[05:12.31] <DV8FromTheWorld> its a model creator
[05:12.36] <GadgetTvMan> for MC.
[05:12.37] <@allaryin> ahh, okay
[05:12.37] <DV8FromTheWorld> you make a block in techne
[05:12.42] <@allaryin> cool
[05:12.46] <DV8FromTheWorld> it spits out java code to work with MC
[05:12.52] <DV8FromTheWorld> i made a circle with it <3
[05:12.53] <@allaryin> interesting
[05:13.07] <GadgetTvMan> i have the base of the stove done. i still need to add some more stuff to it/
[05:13.15] <GadgetTvMan> btw, the techne file is uploaded.
[05:13.20] <DV8FromTheWorld> mm
[05:13.23] <DV8FromTheWorld> im opening now
[05:13.42] <DV8FromTheWorld> i like it!
[05:13.46] <GadgetTvMan> I know.
[05:13.48] <GadgetTvMan> I know.
[05:14.01] <@allaryin> okay
[05:14.05] <GadgetTvMan> I mean, thank you for the complement.
[05:14.06] <DV8FromTheWorld> making the door open.. now thats going to be interesting.
[05:14.06] <@allaryin> so if we made an actual stove item...
[05:14.18] <DV8FromTheWorld> what exactly will it be used for
[05:14.24] <GadgetTvMan> dv8, we need to use java code for that i think.
[05:14.33] <DV8FromTheWorld> yes, you output java
[05:14.36] <@allaryin> i like the idea of having cooktop vs inside stove as different places in the gui
[05:14.37] <DV8FromTheWorld> when your done
[05:14.37] <GadgetTvMan> Well, heating up water. maiking soup.
[05:14.51] <DV8FromTheWorld> ok, lets let al talk
[05:15.01] <GadgetTvMan> NO! Okay.
[05:15.22] <@allaryin> stovetop is unique in that it typically has a number of very distinct spots
[05:15.27] <@allaryin> 4 or 6 or 9 or whatever
[05:15.46] <@allaryin> i had initiall invisioned the grill as working similarly
[05:16.04] <@allaryin> with a 3x3 grid - where spots on the grid were slightly different temperatures
[05:16.10] <DV8FromTheWorld> 4 spots for the stove top
[05:16.22] <DV8FromTheWorld> i still want to do the grill
[05:16.25] <@allaryin> nod
[05:16.29] <@allaryin> idea is this:
[05:16.33] <@allaryin> implement grill
[05:16.33] <DV8FromTheWorld> for stuff that is actually grilled
[05:16.43] <GadgetTvMan> I agree.
[05:16.48] <DV8FromTheWorld> extend to work for the stove?
[05:16.50] <@allaryin> stove is grill + furnace component
[05:16.54] <GadgetTvMan> You can grill with a stove. But you just ont.
[05:16.56] <GadgetTvMan> *dont
[05:17.02] <@allaryin> stove is a second tier machine
[05:17.04] <DV8FromTheWorld> hmm
[05:17.06] <DV8FromTheWorld> i like that
[05:17.12] <DV8FromTheWorld> plus, makes coding easier
[05:17.17] <@allaryin> grill is fire + iron grate
[05:17.18] <DV8FromTheWorld> but
[05:17.25] <DV8FromTheWorld> you cant grill directly on the stove
[05:17.36] <DV8FromTheWorld> you need something to go ontop of the stovetop
[05:17.36] <GadgetTvMan> Correct.
[05:17.37] <@allaryin> you can on some stoves
[05:18.31] <@allaryin> sure
[05:18.32] <@allaryin> or...
[05:18.40] <@allaryin> we just design our stove to work that way
[05:19.10] <DV8FromTheWorld> hmm
[05:19.12] <DV8FromTheWorld> im not sure
[05:19.22] <DV8FromTheWorld> most people, when they think of a stove
[05:19.24] <DV8FromTheWorld> think of this
[05:19.24] <GadgetTvMan> well, i could take out the 2 front stove things and put a gill there.
[05:19.25] <DV8FromTheWorld> +http://appliancerepairinelcajonca.com/images/ge_30_gas_stove_2.JPG,
[05:19.33] <DV8FromTheWorld> there is no way to grill on that
[05:19.45] <@allaryin> you place a grill over two elements
[05:19.49] <@allaryin> also. fire.
[05:20.00] <@allaryin> i've roasted peppers on a gas stove like that w/o modification
[05:21.28] <DV8FromTheWorld> ive never used a gas stove
[05:21.30] <DV8FromTheWorld> so i wouldnt know
[05:21.35] <DV8FromTheWorld> only electric
[05:21.53] <DV8FromTheWorld> or if it was gas, it was conclealed so that you could do that
[05:22.11] <GadgetTvMan> the two stoves that i have eat food from is a wood stove and a gas stove and a electric stove.
[05:22.29] <GadgetTvMan> *three
[05:24.20] <DV8FromTheWorld> thats actually in interesting idea
[05:24.30] <DV8FromTheWorld> have different types of stoves ingame?
[05:24.37] <GadgetTvMan> yeah.
[05:24.45] <@allaryin> once we get core functionality up, there's little reason not to
[05:24.52] <GadgetTvMan> ^
[05:25.01] <DV8FromTheWorld> agreed
[05:25.16] <DV8FromTheWorld> we can still use the electric furnace same as we are for the stew pot
[05:25.22] <DV8FromTheWorld> but have the recipe changed of course
[05:26.39] <DV8FromTheWorld> al, we need to put together a feature/todo list of core functionality
[05:26.56] <DV8FromTheWorld> i know you already have a list started, but i think you said its at work
[05:26.57] <DV8FromTheWorld> right?
[05:27.19] <@allaryin> yes, i was doing it on my work machine and neglected to put it in my dropbox
[05:27.26] <DV8FromTheWorld> :\
[05:27.42] <DV8FromTheWorld> should we start a new list?
[05:27.55] <@allaryin> may as well
[05:29.41] <DV8FromTheWorld> ok, 
[05:29.52] <DV8FromTheWorld> do you want one of us to? or would you like to?
[05:30.01] <DV8FromTheWorld> your might be slightly more....organised
[05:30.05] <@allaryin> laugh
[05:30.07] <DV8FromTheWorld> :D
[05:30.20] <@allaryin> give me a minute to grab the chatlogs and i'll scan through them
[05:30.36] <DV8FromTheWorld> ok, im gonna go get a new mic, mine just broke
