Hacksaw Watermelon

Misc Ideas
----------
* shouldn't turn wheat directly into bread, cake
  - remove vanilla recipe
  - config option to overwrite bread item id (default) or use another id
* melon drops block itself, have to cut it into slices with a knife (ergo mod name)
* milk needs to be less useless, as do eggs, pumpkins, and sheep
* implement mod as a basic api with several separate addons
  - config options to toggle as many behaviors as possible
  - plan for IC2 integration in some addons, but not all
* food quality
  - S > A > B > C > D
  - high grade food lasts longer, provides more saturation
    - B provides some saturation, C provides none
  - eventually food decays in grade - unless preserved somehow
    - grade D food has a chance (~50%) of poisoning you mildly
  - seeds may produce food of grade 0-1 higher than their parent fruit
  - crops in the ground do not decay
? what do we do about fertilizer/bonemeal
* potion-like effects for some foods/juices
  - adding gold nuggets, using gold melon/apple as ingredients
* not going to add salt
? multicolored apples

Resources
---------
* tree fruit
  - banana
  - coconut
  ? vanilla bean
  + durian
  - lime, lemon, orange
  - olive
* ground cropOA
  - pineapple
  ! carrot - naturally occurring in the wild
    - 1-4 per harvest, 1 carrot -> seed
    - edible raw, largely equivalent to apple
  - peas - regrow
  - lettuce - seeds drop from dandelions
  ! barley - naturally occurring in the wild
  - ginger
  - potato
  - onion
  - celery
* special
  + strawberry - spread kind of like groundcover?
  + tomato - double high, regrowing, needs cage/support to reach potential
    - 1/growth cycle unsupported, 4/block/cycle supported
  - corn - triple high, not harvestable until max height
  - rice - requires hydrated plot, adjacent to water
* vanilla
  - milk
  - eggs
  ! sheep - mutton, milk?
  - pumpkin
  ? dandelion

Tools
-----
* chef's knife
  - limited durability
  - works similar to crafting with an rp2 handsaw
  - mince vegetables, chop/grind meat
    - all new crop types would have a chopped ingredient version
  - recipe: stick + iron + clay
* thermos
  - can hold either juice or soup
  - preserves contents
  - capacity of 4 servings
  - bucket wrapped in insulation (ideally tin, wool if we have to)
    - dye thermos to quick id them
  - display fullness using the damage/charge meter
* tin cup
  - use forge tin ingots if available
* cookbook
  - ingame tutorial on the system
    - show you recipes using an ingredient
  - recipe: book + wheat?

Machines
--------
* grill
  - flat crafting grid 
  - slowly cooks items over time
    - corner slots are colder, middle slot is hotter
  - burns charcoal or wood, not coal
* juicer
  - convert fruit/veg into juice
  - use piston in recipe
* stewpot
  - convert food + liquid into stew
  - continual cooking
  - recipe includes cauldron + furnace
  - value = nutrition / liquid
    - if nutrition to liquid ratio gets out of whack (too dry), require more liquid before scoopable
  - cooks slowly
    - whenever an item is added, it must integrate before the newly reconstituted stew may be removed in bowls/thermos
    - chopped ingredients add same nutritional value as raw but integrate much more quickly
  - second tier is electric
* icebox
  - large chest that only holds food items (extra whitelist in config file)
  - front-opening (so stackable)
  - doubles as a crafting machine - certain recipes require chilling perhaps
  - fuel either with snowballs or ic2 or nothing at all
    - 400 eu battery, 8 eu/t to establish temperature, 1 eu/t afterward to maintain
    - when placed, icebox has temperature based on containing biome
  - preserves food
* stove
  - ultimate in kitchen awesome, combines several machines into one
  - at the very least, it provides both grilltop and baking capabilities
    - somehow, we want to encourage using a stove for baking instead of a furnace
  - second tier is electric
? fryer
  - possibly implement as an option on a grilltop somehow
? millstone
  - later addition to automate flour production

Recipes
-------
* flour
  - wheat and barley flour are distinct
  - cobble + grain = cobble + 2 flour 
    - eventually add recipes to produce multiple flour at once
  - 2 wheat flour + 2 white flour = 4 multigrain flour
* dough
  - 4 flour around 1 water = 1 dough (yes, cheaper than vanilla)
  - 4 wheat flour + oil + 1 water = bread dough
  - 4 multigrain flour + oil + 1 water = multigrain bread dough
* bread
  - 1 dough + fire = flatbread (3 hunger)
  - 1 bread dough + fire = bread (new "vanilla" bread, 4 hunger)
  - 1 multigrain dough + fire = multigrain bread (>regular)
* cheese
* vegetable oil
* salad
  - 1x sliced lettuce + 2x other vegetable + bowl
* sandwich
  - 2x sliced bread + filling
* fudge
  - sets in icebox
* pie
  - flour + sugar + butter + water = pie dough
  - pie dough must chill
* sausage
* pancake

Addons
------
- EE2 integration
  - give EMC values to all new raw ingredients
  - no values for machines, tools, processed ingredients, or fancy recipes
- Thaumcraft integration (SSP only, of course)
  - give Vis values for all things with EMC value
- IC2 integration
  - electric machines
  - cropcard support
- Thirst system
  - similar to hunger, depletion rate considers humidity and temperature
  - running, taking damage also deplete
  - all food items have a potential thirst value
  - one bucket of water = 10 units of thirst (full meter)
    - one serving of juice = 1/4 of a bucket = 2.5 thirst
- Preservation
