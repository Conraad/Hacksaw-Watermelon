Hacksaw Watermelon

Misc Ideas
----------
* shouldn't turn wheat directly into bread
  - remove vanilla recipe
  - config option to overwrite bread item id (default) or use another id
* melon drops block itself, have to cut it into slices with a knife (ergo mod name)
* milk needs to be less useless, as do eggs, pumpkins, and sheep
* implement mod as a basic api with several separate addons
  - config options to toggle as many behaviors as possible
  - plan for IC2 integration in some addons, but not all
* food quality
  - S > A > B > C > D
  - high grade food lasts longer, provides more saturation
    - B provides some saturation, C provides none
  - eventually food decays in grade - unless preserved somehow
    - grade D food has a chance (~50%) of poisoning you mildly
  - seeds may produce food of grade 0-1 higher than their parent fruit
  - crops in the ground do not decay
? what do we do about fertilizer/bonemeal
* potion-like effects for some foods/juices
* cookbook

Resources
---------
* tree fruit
  - banana
  - coconut
  ? vanilla bean
  + durian
  - lime, lemon, orange
  - olive
* ground crop
  - pineapple
  ! carrot - naturally occurring in the wild
  - peas - regrow
  - lettuce - seeds drop from dandelions
  ! barley - naturally occurring in the wild
  - ginger
  - potato
  - celery
* special
  + strawberry - spread kind of like groundcover?
  + tomato - double high, regrowing, needs cage/support to reach potential
  + corn - triple high, not harvestable until max height
* vanilla
  - milk
  - eggs
  ! sheep - mutton, milk?
  - pumpkin
  ? dandelion

Tools
-----
* chef's knife
  - limited durability
  - works similar to crafting with an rp2 handsaw
  - mince vegetables, chop/grind meat
    - all new crop types would have a chopped ingredient version
  - recipe: stick + iron + clay
* thermos
  - can hold either juice or soup
  - preserves contents
  - capacity of 4 servings

Machines
--------
* grill
  - flat crafting grid 
  - slowly cooks items over time
    - corner slots are colder, middle slot is hotter
  - burns charcoal or wood, not coal
* juicer
  - convert fruit/veg into juice
* stewpot
  - convert food + liquid into stew
  - continual cooking
  - recipe includes cauldron + furnace
  - value = nutrition / liquid
  - cooks slowly
    - whenever an item is added, it must integrate before the newly reconstituted stew may be removed in bowls/thermos
    - chopped ingredients add same nutritional value as raw but integrate much more quickly
* icebox
  - large chest that only holds food items (extra whitelist in config file)
  - front-opening (so stackable)
  - doubles as a crafting machine - certain recipes require chilling perhaps
  - fuel either with snowballs or ic2 or nothing at all
  - preserves food
* stove
  - ultimate in kitchen awesome, combines several machines into one
  - at the very least, it provides both grilltop and baking capabilities
? fryer
  - possibly implement as an option on a grilltop somehow
? millstone
  - later addition to automate flour production

Recipes
-------
* flour
  - wheat and barley flour are distinct
  - cobble + grain = cobble + 2 flour 
    - eventually add recipes to produce multiple flour at once
  - 2 wheat flour + 2 white flour = 4 multigrain flour
* dough
  - 4 flour around 1 water = 1 dough (yes, cheaper than vanilla)
  - 4 wheat flour + oil + 1 water = bread dough
  - 4 multigrain flour + oil + 1 water = multigrain bread dough
* bread
  - 1 dough + fire = flatbread (3 hunger)
  - 1 bread dough + fire = bread (new "vanilla" bread, 4 hunger)
  - 1 multigrain dough + fire = multigrain bread (>regular)
* cheese
* vegetable oil
* salad
  - 1x sliced lettuce + 2x other vegetable + bowl
* sandwich
  - 2x sliced bread + filling
* fudge
  - sets in icebox
* pie
  - flour + sugar + butter + water = pie dough
  - pie dough must chill

Addons
------
- EE2 integration
  - give EMC values to all new raw ingredients
  - no values for machines, tools, processed ingredients, or fancy recipes
- Thaumcraft integration (SSP only, of course)
  - give Vis values for all things with EMC value
- Thirst system
  - similar to hunger, depletion rate considers humidity and temperature
